/*

SEVEN BUILT-IN TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT

- null
- undefined
- boolean
- number
- string
- object
- symbol

All of these types excpect object are called primitives.


Functions and Arrays are subtypes to object.

VALUES HAVE TYPES, NOT VARIABLES.

Note: Many developers believe there should never be any variables in the global namespace, and that everything should be contained in modules and private/separate namespaces. This is great in theory but nearly impossible in practicality; still it's a good goal to strive toward! Fortunately, ES6 added first-class support for modules, which will eventually make that much more practical.
